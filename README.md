bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Jack-khalif.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Jack-khalif
Open index.html or contentDetails.html in your preferred browser (you can open directly or serve via a local server).

7. Notes / Troubleshooting
The project uses vanilla JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest for fetching product data.

The live API endpoint is: https://5d76bf96515d1a0014085cf9.mockapi.io/product/

For development, ensure that you are serving your files on a local HTTP server rather than opening via file:// protocol to avoid CORS or path issues.

Example local server (Python):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m http.server
Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
