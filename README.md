```bash
git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Jack-khalif.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash

## 7. Notes / Troubleshooting

* The project uses vanilla JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest for fetching product data.
* The live API endpoint is: `https://5d76bf96515d1a0014085cf9.mockapi.io/product/`
* For development, ensure that you are serving your files on a local HTTP server rather than opening via `file://` protocol to avoid CORS or path issues.
* Example local server (Python):

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
